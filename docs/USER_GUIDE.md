## 2. Three Things You Need

## 3. One-Time Setup (15 mins)

### Step 1 ‚Äì Create Supabase Project

1. Go to **https://supabase.com** ‚Üí *New project*.
2. Choose a name & region, click **Create project**.
3. Copy these two values (you will need them later):  
   ‚Ä¢ **Project URL**  
   ‚Ä¢ **Anon public key**

### Step 2 ‚Äì Import the Database

1. In Supabase, click **SQL Editor**.
2. Open the `supabase-setup.sql` file (included with the template) and **paste** everything into the editor.
3. Press **RUN**.  This creates all tables, rules and a default admin user.

### Step 3 ‚Äì Create a Storage Bucket (for notice images)

1. In Supabase, go to **Storage ‚Üí New bucket**.  
2. Name it **notices** (exact spelling).  
3. Keep *Public bucket* **ON** and save.

‚û°Ô∏è  Done!  Supabase is ready.

### Step 4 ‚Äì Deploy the Website

1. Sign in to **https://vercel.com** with GitHub / GitLab.
2. Click **New Project** ‚Üí *Import* the repository (or click *Deploy with Vercel* button if provided).
3. When Vercel asks for **Environment Variables**, add:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` ‚Üí value from step 3-1
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` ‚Üí value from step 3-1
4. Keep all other settings default ‚Üí **Deploy**.

After ~1 minute you will get a public URL like `https://your-clinic.vercel.app` ‚Äì share it with the world!

## 5. Customising the Website (No Coding Needed)

### A. Replace Logo & Images

1. Open the **public** folder in your repo.  
2. Replace `shubham-logo.png`, hero images, gallery photos etc. with your own.  
   ‚Ä¢ Keep the **same filenames** to avoid code changes.

### B. Update Clinic Details

2. Edit clinic name, address, email, phone, social links.

2. Click *Services* section.  
3. Add, edit or delete treatments.  They appear instantly on the public site.

### D. Manage Appointment Slots

1. In Admin, open **Time Management**.  
2. Set working hours, holidays, and slot length (e.g. 15 min).  
3. Patients will only see available times.

### E. Post Notices (Announcements)

1. Admin ‚Üí **Notice Board**.  
2. Click *New Notice*, upload an image (stored in Supabase) and text.  
3. The notice shows on the home page carousel.

### F. Multi-Language Texts

The template ships with English & Gujarati.  If you would like to edit wording:

1. Go to `src/i18n/translations`.  
2. Open the language file (e.g. `home.ts`).  
3. Change the text between quotes and save.

‚ö†Ô∏è  If you add a **brand-new language** you will need a developer to update some code.  Ask us!
